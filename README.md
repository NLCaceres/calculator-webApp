# Calculator WebApp

Simple Web App using Vanilla JS and custom images to make a little calculator

## Description

My fourth attempt in a class at USC to make a WebApp. With my limited knowledge of Javascript
and a few images found online that could be used for a calculator with a theme, I hoped to make
a simple calculator in the style of google's calculator.
